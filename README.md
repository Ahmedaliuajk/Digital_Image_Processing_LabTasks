# 📘 Digital Image Processing – Lab Tasks

This repository contains implementations of fundamental Digital Image Processing (DIP) techniques completed for the **Digital Image Processing** subject. The tasks include RGB color analysis, grayscale and binary conversion, Connected Component Labeling (CCL), and histogram equalization.


## 🧪 Task 1 – RGB Image Display
This task focuses on understanding RGB color representation in digital images.

### ✔ Operations Performed
- Displayed the **original RGB image**
- Extracted and visualized the **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue** channels
- Observed how each channel contributes to the final image

---

## 🧪 Task 2 – Connected Component (CC) Labeling
This task applies **Connected Component Labeling** to identify objects within an image.

### ✔ Operations Performed
- Converted the input image to **binary**
- Applied **Connected Component Labeling (CCL)**
- Displayed labeled regions using different colors or numeric labels
- Analyzed the number and structure of connected components

---

## 🧪 Task 3 – Coin Image Processing
A coin image is processed through multiple stages to identify objects.

### ✔ Operations Performed
- Displayed the **RGB image**
- Extracted and displayed **R**, **G**, and **B** component images
- Converted the image to **grayscale**
- Converted the grayscale image to **binary**
- Applied **Connected Component Labeling** to detect and count coin-like objects

---

## 🧪 Task 4 – Histogram Equalization
This task enhances the visual contrast of an image using histogram equalization.

### ✔ Operations Performed
- Converted the image to **grayscale**
- Computed the image histogram
- Applied **Histogram Equalization**
- Displayed and compared the **original** and **contrast-enhanced** images
